<p style="text-align: justify;">
    An indigenous community produces jute slippers and created a website to sell the production online. Slippers are of only one type, but they are produced in various sizes. The stock can be seen as a table with a single row, in which each column (1-base index) represents a size and a number in column - amount of slippers of that size. When a slipper is sold, the stock must be updated. If the stock for a size of slippers have zero value, slippers of this size cannot be sold. That is, the sale is not carried out.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Given the initial inventory and the list of customer orders (sizes), write a program to determine how many slippers are actually sold in total. Each order means size and refers to a single slipper. The Sales are processed sequentially, in the order in which the orders were placed. If a sale it is not possible due to lack of stock, the corresponding order is ignored.
